      <description><![CDATA[<p>Chana has traced the history of the school from its founding and come to the present. But now: One unexpected last chapter. Last year, the school district for BHS mandated a change in the zoning process to ensure all middle schools would be racially integrated. No longer can white families hoard resources in a few select schools. Black and Latino parents have been demanding this change since the late 1950s. The courts have mandated it.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Public schools are inequitable because the school systems are maniacally loyal to white families. We can’t have equitable public education unless schools limit the disproportionate power of white parents. But is that even possible? Chana finds two schools that are trying to do just that, and both are actually inside the 293 building. One is downstairs in the basement, where a charter school called Success Academy opened about 7 years ago. The other is upstairs at BHS, the newly renamed SIS.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/rAgzxY6ICCg" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

      <title>Nice White Parents - Ep. 3</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Chana Joffe-Walt explores how white parents can shape a school — even when they aren’t there.</p>
<p>She traces the history of I.S. 293, now the Boerum Hill School for International Studies, from the 1980s through the modern education reforms of the 2000s. In the process, Chana talks to alumni who loved their school and never questioned why it was on the edge of a white neighborhood. To them, it was just where everyone went. But she also speaks to some who watched the school change over the years and questioned whether a local community school board was secretly plotting against 293.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/xX2quyWxQ7I" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Chana Joffe-Walt searches the New York City Board of Education archives for more information about the School for International Studies, which was originally called I.S. 293.</p>
<p>In the process, she finds a folder of letters written in 1963 by mostly white families in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. They are asking for the board to change the proposed construction of the school to a site where it would be more likely to be racially integrated.</p>
<p>It’s less than a decade after Brown v. Board of Education, amid a growing civil rights movement, and the white parents writing letters are emphatic that they want an integrated school. They get their way and the school site changes — but after that, nothing else goes as planned.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/j6IOyu_7uRw" height="1" width="1" alt="" />

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s 2015 and one Brooklyn middle school is about to receive a huge influx of new students. </p>
<p>Reporter Chana Joffe Walt follows  what happens when the School for International Studies’s 6th grade class swells from 30 mostly Latino, Black and Middle Eastern students, to a class of 103 —an influx almost entirely driven by white families.</p>
<p>Everyone wants “what’s best for the school” but it becomes clear that they don’t share the same vision of what “best” means.</p>

      <title>S01 Episode 02: The Breakup</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Their relationship began like a storybook high-school romance: a prom date, love notes, sneaking off to be alone. But unlike other kids at school, they had to keep their dating secret, because their parents disapproved. Both of them, but especially Adnan, were under special pressure at home, and the stress of that spilled over into their relationship. Eventually Hae broke up with Adnan.
