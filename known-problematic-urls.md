https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/ has a meta tag with (apparently) a single blog entry. Not sure if we need a special rule or just more aggressive/intelligent autodiscovery code.

We're only finding an empty feed they've mistakenly linked from a metatag. There don't seem to be any other recognizable links.
