# It seems when we skip episodes we may be leaving a bunch of whitespace in the output file... need to clean this up.

https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/ has a meta tag with (apparently) a single blog entry. Not sure if we need a special rule or just more aggressive/intelligent autodiscovery code.

# https://www.alieward.com/ologies

We autodiscover a weird truncated (by squarespace) feed that _doesn't have podcast enclosures!_ (https://www.alieward.com/ologies?format=rss)
I can't see anything on the page to grab onto
We can find the apple podcast with https://itunes.apple.com/search?media=podcast&entity=podcast&limit=2&term=ologies
... but I'm not sure how to reliably construct the search term as it doesn't seem very flexible

Maybe this is a job for the search api at listennotes?

https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/podcasts has a meta tag to an empty feed. All of the actual feed links are locked behind a javascript popup

Throws an error in the firefox preview (though the feed appears to work due to lenient clients)
I guess I need to add the itunes namespace?

We're only finding an empty feed they've mistakenly linked from a metatag. There don't seem to be any other recognizable links.

# https://hidden-brain.simplecast.com/

This is a SPA page so there are no links. Probably need to be found with a search.

# https://feed.thisamericanlife.org/talpodcast

https gets a tls handshake eof from the feed link found in a metatag
we might be able to detect this sort of thing and attempt http

# https://www.youtube.com/mythicalkitchen

video links? I guess I'll we'd need to do is relax the type check

# https://themoth.org

The actual feed links are just one hop away... should we follow "subscribe" or "listen" links at least one hop? same domain limit?

# Links to test
